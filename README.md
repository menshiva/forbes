# Forbes

A simple casino slot machine game for Atmel AVR Butterfly written in Assembly language.

There are three reels. The main task of the game is to stop all of these reels with the same picture on them (_Note_: picture on a reel is generated "randomly" from 0-9 and A-F).
At the end of the game you'll see "WINNER" if all reels have the same picture or "LOOSER" otherwise.

This project is a final homework of the **Computer Structures and Architectures** course at the [Faculty of Information Technology, CTU in Prague](https://fit.cvut.cz/en).
